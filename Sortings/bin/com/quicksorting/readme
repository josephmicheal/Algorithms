The Quicksort algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer approach. Overall, the quicksort algorithm follows three main steps:

Pick an element from the array as a pivot
Partition the problem set by moving smaller elements to the left of the pivot and larger elements to its right
Repeat the above steps on each partition
